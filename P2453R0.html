 *                   Style sheet for the W3C specifications                   *
 *
 * Special classes handled by this style sheet include:
 *
 * Indices
 *   - .toc for the Table of Contents (<ol class="toc">)
 *     + <span class="secno"> for the section numbers
 *   - #toc for the Table of Contents (<nav id="toc">)
 *   - ul.index for Indices (<a href="#ref">term</a><span>, in § N.M</span>)
 *   - table.index for Index Tables (e.g. for properties or elements)
 *
 * Structural Markup
 *   - table.data for general data tables
 *     -> use 'scope' attribute, <colgroup>, <thead>, and <tbody> for best results !
 *     -> use <table class='complex data'> for extra-complex tables
 *     -> use <td class='long'> for paragraph-length cell content
 *     -> use <td class='pre'> when manual line breaks/indentation would help readability
 *   - dl.switch for switch statements
 *   - ol.algorithm for algorithms (helps to visualize nesting)
 *   - .figure and .caption (HTML4) and figure and figcaption (HTML5)
 *     -> .sidefigure for right-floated figures
 *   - ins/del
 *     -> ins/del.c### for candidate and proposed changes (amendments)
 *
 * Code
 *   - pre and code
 *
 * Special Sections
 *   - .note       for informative notes             (div, p, span, aside, details)
 *   - .example    for informative examples          (div, p, pre, span)
 *   - .issue      for issues                        (div, p, span)
 *   - .advisement for loud normative statements     (div, p, strong)
 *   - .annoying-warning for spec obsoletion notices (div, aside, details)
 *   - .correction for "candidate corrections"       (div, aside, details, section)
 *   - .addition   for "candidate additions"         (div, aside, details, section)
 *   - .correction.proposed for "proposed corrections" (div, aside, details, section)
 *   - .addition.proposed   for "proposed additions"   (div, aside, details, section)
 *
 * Definition Boxes
 *   - pre.def   for WebIDL definitions
 *   - table.def for tables that define other entities (e.g. CSS properties)
 *   - dl.def    for definition lists that define other entitles (e.g. HTML elements)
 *
 * Numbering
 *   - .secno for section numbers in .toc and headings (<span class='secno'>3.2</span>)
 *   - .marker for source-inserted example/figure/issue numbers (<span class='marker'>Issue 4</span>)
 *   - ::before styled for CSS-generated issue/example/figure numbers:
 *     -> Documents wishing to use this only need to add
 *        figcaption::before,
 *        .caption::before { content: "Figure "  counter(figure) " ";  }
 *        .example::before { content: "Example " counter(example) " "; }
 *        .issue::before   { content: "Issue "   counter(issue) " ";   }
 *
 * Header Stuff (ignore, just don't conflict with these classes)
 *   - .head for the header
 *   - .copyright for the copyright
 *
 * Outdated warning for old specs
 *
 * Miscellaneous
 *   - .overlarge for things that should be as wide as possible, even if
 *     that overflows the body text area. This can be used on an item or
 *     on its container, depending on the effect desired.
 *     Note that this styling basically doesn't help at all when printing,
 *     since A4 paper isn't much wider than the max-width here.
 *     It's better to design things to fit into a narrower measure if possible.
 *
 *   - js-added ToC jump links (see fixup.js)

   <p>In October 2021, the C++ Library Evolution group conducted a series of
  electronic decision polls on Networking and Executors <a data-link-type="biblio" href="https://wg21.link/P2452R0">[P2452R0]</a>.
This paper provides the results of those polls and summarizes the results.</p>
   <p>In total, 56 people participated in the polls.
Some participants opted to not vote on some polls.
Thank you to everyone who participated, and to the proposal authors for all
  their hard work!</p>

       <p>What this doesn’t mean: It doesn’t mean that the Networing TS async model isn’t a good fit for networking. There were many comments to the contrary.</p>
       <p>What this means: If the authors continue to pursue a design similar to the current Networking TS, they would have an easier time getting consensus by focusing on the networking side of things, rather than proposing the design for general asynchrony.</p>
     <tr>
      <td style="padding-bottom: 16px;"> Poll 2: The sender/receiver model (P2300) is a good basis for most asynchronous use cases, including networking, parallelism, and GPUs.

       <p>What this doesn’t mean: It doesn’t mean that S&amp;R is going into C++23 (though it might). It doesn’t mean that <a data-link-type="biblio" href="https://wg21.link/p2300r2">[P2300R2]</a> as it stands today will be sent forward to Library. It doesn’t prevent us from adding new asynchronous models in the future.</p>
       <p>What this means: Work will continue in Library Evolution on refining <a data-link-type="biblio" href="https://wg21.link/p2300r2">[P2300R2]</a>, and Library Evolution will keep the various asynchronous use cases in mind while working on <a data-link-type="biblio" href="https://wg21.link/p2300r2">[P2300R2]</a>.</p>

       <p>What this doesn’t mean: The Networking TS is not "dead".</p>
       <p>What this means: The C++ Committee will still work on networking in this general form, but the authors need to do a lot in order to build up consensus to get something like the TS merged into the standard. The bulk of this work should be done in Networking Study Group. Many of the people in favor of stopping work on the TS would like networking to be built on top of Senders and Receivers. Others were opposed to the lack of security through Transport Layer Security (TLS). It is highly unlikely that design changes to the Networking TS can be made fast enough, and consensus gained fast enough, for networking to make C++23.</p>

       Weak consensus. 
       <p>What this doesn’t mean: Work on networking using other models will still be reviewed and considered on its own merits. WG21 doesn’t pause work on a concrete paper based off of the wish for another paper. Note that there are a high number of neutrals on this vote. Many of the neutrals (and some of the abstentions) would like to see a paper before picking a side here.</p>
       <p>What this means: In the short term, this poll result doesn’t mean much. We don’t have a paper in hand that proposes networking based on the <a data-link-type="biblio" href="https://wg21.link/p2300r2">[P2300R2]</a> model. For paper authors though, this poll is encouragement to do work in the area of networking based on senders and receivers, or to be prepared with compelling new information on why networking should use a different model.</p>

       <p>What this means: A networking library that does not support secure sockets will face significant headwinds getting through the standardization process.</p>
       <p>What this doesn’t mean: This doesn’t make a statement on whether insecure networking should be included, the defaults of secure vs. insecure, or how things like ABI should managed.</p>

   <p>Before bringing networking papers back to Library Evolution, two major areas
  need to be thoroughly addressed: Security, and the Senders and Receivers async
  model <a data-link-type="biblio" href="https://wg21.link/p2300r2">[P2300R2]</a>.</p>
   <p>Those voting in favor of Poll 5 argued that the insecure parts are the building
  blocks for the secure parts, and that ABI is major concern that will plague TLS
  support. Those voting against Poll 5 argued that secure sockets are needed for
  communicating with many sites on the internet, and that shipping without secure
  sockets would be irresponsible. A networking proposal needs to address these
  concerns before coming to LEWG.</p>
   <p>As for networking in combination with Senders and Receivers, the following poll
  result from the <a href="https://wiki.edg.com/bin/view/Wg21telecons2021/Executors-2021-09-28">2021-09-28 telecon</a> may be informative:</p>

   <p>The combination of this "grand unified model" poll and Poll 4 heavily
  encourages the networking study group to produce a paper based on Senders and
  Receivers. There is room to produce a non-S&amp;R paper, but such a paper would
  need to provide compelling new information in order to convince the "grand
  unified model" contingent that S&amp;R can’t get the job done suitably.</p>

   <blockquote>
    <p>I’m voting in favour in this poll because, based on implementation experience, I understand that the Networking TS/Asio model is indeed capable of supporting these use cases.</p>
    <p>However, a comment on the poll itself: It appears to presume that we must have a single asynchronous model. In the previous LEWG call dated 2020-09-28, a poll was taken on the question "We must have a single async model for the C++ Standard Library". There was no consensus, and that question was not re-asked before taking this poll.</p>

    <p>Asio/Net.TS is proven in multiple disciplines, many corporations</p>

    <p>This design seems capable of being used by any higher-level concurrency framework, e.g. senders/receivers, so seems like a good basis even if it alone is not sufficient to serve the needs of most users.</p>

   <blockquote>
    <p>The TS/Asio model seems well suited to network programming, if a bit cumbersome for GPU programming it doesn’t seem antithetical to it. The interface in <a data-link-type="biblio" href="https://wg21.link/p2300r2">[P2300R2]</a> seems more in line with the compute use-cases, and <a data-link-type="biblio" href="https://wg21.link/p2444r0">[P2444R0]</a> to async event-driven use-cases. That said, I don’t think the difference is as stark as has been made out.</p>

   <blockquote>
    <p>I have much more personal experience with prototyping around scheduler/sender/receiver and have not prototyped parallelism using the model in Networking TS. During LEWG/SG1 calls, there have been claims about the suitability or lack of suitability of the networking TS model for various asynchronous use cases. Because of this, we are now beginning an internal evaluation of this model for our use cases but have not yet done this evaluation. I believe the result could go in either direction, and so I’m neutral.</p>
    <p>— Neutral</p>
   </blockquote>
   <blockquote>
    <p>My vote is neutral as I am not familiar enough with the networking requirements to have an opinion on those, and I have not seen enough of Asio being used for GPU use cases to have an opinion on whether it would satisfy the requirements there.</p>
    <p>— Neutral</p>
   </blockquote>
   <blockquote>
    <p>It has demonstrated it fits networking. It has not demonstrated it fits GPUs, and I buy Michal’s arguments that it does not. I have no first-person experience to evaluate those myself, though.</p>
    <p>— Neutral</p>
   </blockquote>
   <blockquote>
    <p>Unfortunately didn’t have enough time to deeply understand the Networking TS model (that’s why I am Neutral) but at first glance it seems to be a good basic for everything that’s listed in the poll with some tweaks. Somebody claims that there is no clear error channel and cancellation mechanism that fits necessary use-cases. I tend to believe in those claims but I think this model can be extended to fulfill people expectations.</p>
    <p>The very basic asynchronous model (IMO) should have kind of spawn the "task", wait for completion of the "task" (group of tasks), the way to express dependencies between "tasks", the way to dynamically add more "tasks" (create other tasks within some "task" execution), error channel and cancellation. I think that Networking TS looks quite low-level to build everything on top of that and if it’s not immediately fulfills the requirements to async model I’ve described above we may think how it can be extended to support those.</p>
    <p>Again, I need to deeper dive into Networking TS to form clearer opinion. I just put some ruminations basing what I’ve already learned.</p>
    <p>— Neutral</p>

    <p>Despite several presentations on the subject, the <a data-link-type="biblio" href="https://wg21.link/p2444r0">[P2444R0]</a> model still seems quite mysterious. Obviously it has found extensive, productive use in practice, but some of its fundamental concepts are complicated and the import of the examples has been obfuscated by (important!) details like coroutine support and by their domain specificity.</p>

    <p>NetTS async model combination of errors and results into a single completion signature is limiting and problematic for cases where an operation fails and I might not be able to construct a result-value, or the result-value might not have a suitable invalid state.
The model also seems to either encourage use of shared_ptr for keeping state alive or require custom-allocators and callers to guess how much storage to reserve for the allocator to pass to child operations. This makes it challenging to compose operations efficiently.</p>

    <p>The proponents of the Net.TS postulate that it is, while SG1 and GPU experts say that it is not, which ties in with my (somewhat limited) expertise. I am voting weakly agains because while I can not disprove NetTS, I have limited confidence. Furthermore the NetTS’s async model does not have genericity as its goal, which I think is crucial for a composable Basis.</p>

    <p>The async model in <a data-link-type="biblio" href="https://wg21.link/p2444r0">[P2444R0]</a> focuses on how work is executed and wants to create an API for that.

   <blockquote>
    <p>Though the Asio model has proven history that demonstrates it is <em>usable</em> for networking, it has always seemed awkward to me in practice, so I wouldn’t say it is a <em>good</em> basis for networking. In addition, it is primarily networking-focused, and is not a good fit for other asynchronous code.</p>

   <blockquote>
    <p>The Asio async model is not a fully developed model that people can use today. It attempts to be the basis of some future machinery people can actually use. Furthermore, it does not allow capturing/representing all asynchronous work as a single task graph necessary for kernel fusion.</p>

    <p>Asio is a popular and robust library _for_ _networking_. However, Asio supporters show little interest in supporting use cases outside their own narrow domain, unlike <a data-link-type="biblio" href="https://wg21.link/p2300r2">[P2300R2]</a> supporters. Also, Asio’s flexibility makes it more likely that users will choose easy but wrong ways to manage object lifetimes and concurrency.</p>
    <p>On one (I think the first) of three LEWG sessions on the Networking TS and Asio, the Asio proponent began a 90-minute talk on the Asio asynchronous programming model. They used that phrase -- "asynchronous programming model" -- yet had no examples from parallel computing. The apparent duration of their talk showed that they had no interest in learning more. I contrast this with <a data-link-type="biblio" href="https://wg21.link/p2300r2">[P2300R2]</a>, where the authors' use cases included I/O and networking.</p>
    <p>It was startling to see firsthand, what I had heard from a friend in the parallel computing community who is not normally involved in WG21: that Asio supporters have no interest in supporting use cases outside their own. In further mailing list discussion, Asio supporters showed that they did not want to consider use cases from networking and I/O on computers with limited memory or other resources.</p>
    <p>I know this sounds like an ad hominem argument, but we’re dealing with complicated proposals that are different mainly in the subtle details. We voters need some confidence that a proposal’s authors actually care about use cases. Asio proponents' behavior does not give us that confidence.</p>
    <p>Regarding Asio’s flexibility, remarks by Kirk Shoop and Niall Douglas on the reflector influenced my views. My understanding is that Asio supports many different ways to manage object lifetimes and "do parallelism."  As a result, less experienced users reach for the easy thing, shared_ptr. This makes it impossible to reason about object lifetimes. Senders/receivers, by contrast, _only_ supports one way to reason about object lifetimes. This requires more effort, but leads users down the correct path.</p>

I knew it was wrong. Fortunately I met Lewis Baker thanks to Eric
Niebler and Lewis explained  how to structure lifetimes in async code
without adhoc GC. His solution recovers the lifetime management that
is core to C++ as a language. This solution is baked into
sender/receiver and allows an async operation to pass a raw reference
into another async operation, secure in the knowledge that the
reference will be valid for the lifetime of the other async operation.
This restores local reasoning for lifetimes to async code in C++. The
idea that C++ would introduce an async pattern that discards this core principal of C++ is surprising.</p>

     <p>To add to that valid observation, if a programmer is lazy, ASIO’s design tends to lead naturally to the use of shared_ptr or some other atomics-based reference counting mechanism.

Good devs do invest that effort, and here tends to have more good devs than is normal.</p>
     <p>Most devs however are lazy, so correspondingly most ASIO code uses shared_ptr. Anyone here on WG21 with enough experience with ASIO will be able to recount stories of having to debug somebody else’s ASIO code, and ultimately finding the cause of the (usually random and hard to repeat) failures ultimately came down to the choice to use shared_ptr.</p>
     <p>Sender-Receiver requires more typing to use in my experience, so lazy devs will dislike it, but its design tends against the use of shared_ptr. Rather, you tend to set up graphs of Sender-Receiver and you execute some or all of that graph. Shared ptr or reference counting isn’t particularly useful in that design model.</p>

    <p>I’ve used Asio for both traditional and HPC network programming in the past.

    <p>However, I’m far from convinced that it is universal or general. It doesn’t support rich error channels or cancellation. It’s also not well suited for structured, compositional parallelism - e.g. building task graphs or dataflow programming. Additionally, it is unclear on which execution contexts certain operations execute, such as error handling. I do not think the Networking TS/Asio model gives users as much control over where things execute as other models, such as senders/receivers.</p>
    <p>It’s certainly not suitable for GPU programming; it has no notion of bulk execution, and the composition model would require either transfers of control to the host or dynamic parallelism, neither of which are efficient on GPUs.

    <p>I’ve become confident that the sender/receiver model is the right set of generic abstractions for us to build asynchronous interfaces upon. It has first-class support for rich error channels and cancellation, which are must-have features to certain users. It has very clear semantics about what execution contexts operations occur on. It’s based on lazy execution, but supports eagerization, which is the correct design, as eager can be efficiently implemented on top of lazy, but not vice versa. It also has a notion of bulk parallelism, which is essential for supporting GPUs. We can also extend senders/receivers in the future to support asynchronous streams (e.g. senders that send multiple values).</p>
    <p>I view the sender/receiver model as the generalization of the future/promise model that has been pervasive throughout the C++ ecosystem (not <code class="highlight"><c- n>std</c-><c- o>::</c-><c- n>future</c-></code>/<code class="highlight"><c- n>std</c-><c- o>::</c-><c- n>promise</c-></code>, but the general idea). The future/promise model with <code class="highlight"><c- p>.</c-><c- n>then</c-></code> continuations is good, but it had limitations - it assumed the existence of a shared state (which implied synchronization and allocation), it didn’t really support cancellation, it was unclear what execution context operations occur on, it doesn’t have a notion of sending multiple asynchronous values, etc. Senders/receivers builds on the proven future/promise model, addressing these faults and giving us something we can truly call a "grand unified model" of asynchrony.</p>

Even if the direction looks fine there are missing parts IMO.</p>
    <p>First of all, there are no query APIs. User knows nothing about execution context resources, nested parallelism support, etc. to build performant implementation of compute parallelism on top of that. The paper claims that it maps on SYCL programming model but SYCL does have query APIs to get additional information about the device and we use that in our code for the sake of performance.</p>
    <p>The second thing is <a data-link-type="biblio" href="https://wg21.link/p2300r2">[P2300R2]</a> no longer supports possibly eager execution (except some way to express eagerness with ensure_started) that makes it less friendly for parallelism on CPU and in some cases on GPU as well. I’ve often heard from users that they are interested in asynchrony but they also want to start the execution for individually submitted parts of the work as soon as possible and wait for completion of all those in one place.</p>
    <p>The third thing. If I understand correctly removing eagerness support makes it much harder to build dynamic dependency graph when user may add more work on the fly to the already executing graph. That makes it harder to express "task"-based parallelism.</p>

I would be very careful with adding something into the standard with the for asynchrony that also targets to support parallelism well unless we have the clear understanding how this programming model interoperates with the rest relevant C++ standard library parts.</p>
    <p>One can say "all that listed can be added later" and I tend to believe that technically it’s possible but practically I consider the things above essential to support at once in one standard release (C++23 or 26 or whatever) (not necessarily in one proposal) because C++ is quite low-level language that should give reasonably good performance. Lacking the things that helps with performant implementation looks like showstopper to me.</p>
    <p>Another counter-argument to what’s I’ve said about performance could be that "scheduler algorithms can be customized" but I think in that case we loose the value of genericity. I anticipate (but do not claim for 100%) that most implementations of algorithms that use schedulers would be customized for known types basically using those schedulers as the tags with ignoring the rest of APIs right to provide efficient implementation. In that case of treating schedulers as the tags we don’t even need such complexity that we have in <a data-link-type="biblio" href="https://wg21.link/p2300r2">[P2300R2]</a>.</p>

   <blockquote>
    <p>While I believe the core of Asio model is good, although not suitable as basis for asynchrony in the C++ Standard Library (see poll 1), I do not think we should proceed with the Networking TS design. The design of the Networking TS is very opinionated, and the facility itself is quite large - so large that Library Evolution struggles to build institutional knowledge about it. While an opinionated design is fine for a 3rd party library like Asio, a Standard Library component needs to be universal and consistent with the rest of the Standard Library. I’m not convinced that the Networking TS is.</p>
    <p>The Networking TS was designed in a different era (2015-2018); C++ Standard Library design has evolved a lot since then, and I do not think the Networking TS has kept up. In particular I think there are a lot of questionable practices in the Networking TS regarding object lifetimes and value categories. It is likely that there are many modernizations that we’d need to make.</p>
    <p>Additionally, the Networking TS uses type erasure and inheritance in a number of places. This is very hazardous in the C++ Standard Library, given our current stance that we must preserve ABI stability. For something like networking, where security is a concern and best practices change over time, we must be able to fix our mistakes and evolve the facility after it ships. I think that requires a design that plans for ABI resiliency from the ground up.</p>
    <p>Finally, and most fatally, I think it is completely unacceptable for us to ship a networking facility in Standard C++ that is not secure by default and designed for future evolution to correct security flaws. The world is moving towards TLS as a requirement - many websites can only be accessed through https for example. If we standardize a networking facility that is not only insecure by default, but has no support for secure communication, it will not age well. 10 years from now, we may find that facilities that do not support secure networking are entirely unusable. There’s a reason the industry is moving to secure by default - security flaws can have major impacts on human lives, property, and the environment. Insecure systems can literally get people killed.</p>

    <p>We need to learn to crawl before we can run. Why we try to shove a network library in the standard when we don’t have the basis figured out is beyond me.

    <p>More importantly, we shouldn’t hate implementers and users so much as to force on them the burden of two different non-composable models.

We need to think in terms of ecosystem here, not in term of shipping disjointed features so we can cross them out of our Christmas list.</p>

    <p>I was particularly influenced by some discussion on the mailing list:</p>

     <p>I still don’t understand why we insist on conflating i/o with asynchronicity or concurrency. We should start with multiplexing i/o on a single thread with a submission and completions queue: you add items to the submission queue if there is space (otherwise you defer to later), you reap completions from the completions queue. That’s all we need for Networking as a bare minimum viable. And that model works beautifully in a 2Kb RAM CPU, never mind a 128Kb RAM CPU.</p>
     <p>You might note that io_uring and Windows RIO literally do exactly what I just described. So did POSIX aio, though poorly.</p>
     <p>Sender-Receiver naturally fits a single threaded submission-completions queue model. And not a single mention of asynchronous nor concurrent anything is needed here.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This reminds me a lot of a second-hand story about an MPI (Message Passing Interface for distributed-memory parallel computing, a 30-year-old industry standard that has its issues but works just about everywhere) expert who could not manage to convince the Asio folks to care about his use case. The second sentence in Niall’s quote above is not very different from how MPI messages work. It does seem like there’s always some assumption in Asio folks' minds about having extra compute resources to make progress on networking tasks in the background. This does not align with C++'s goal to work on all sorts of hardware.</p>

    <p>All of the arguments have convinced me that networking _could_ be based on the sender/receiver model, and that this would be a good approach, even on computers with limited memory or other resources. I’m also convinced that networking could integrate naturally with parallel computing using senders/receivers, and that it’s thus worth having a single programming model instead of two. Of the two models being discussed here, I think <a data-link-type="biblio" href="https://wg21.link/p2300r2">[P2300R2]</a> is a better choice for this integration use case.</p>

Standard certificate-based security involves a great deal of configuration and dynamic, persistent data that is not easily integrated into or deployed with the standard library. Other technologies (e.g., SSH) would have to be implemented as a layer on top of the standard library regardless, and it does not seem particularly harmful to standardize (only) ordinary sockets that can be wrapped into any of several such layers.</p>

    <p>While it is desirable to provide support for TLS, there are sufficient use cases for socket-based networking without TLS to justify its use and inclusion in the library.

    <p>Asio already puts that as a layer on top of the networking functionality, so we can further explore Standard solutions while third party libraries can provide these layers.</p>
